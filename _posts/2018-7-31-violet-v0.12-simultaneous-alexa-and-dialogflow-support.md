With the previous release you could deploy an app to Amazon Alexa or Google Dialogflow, however, but not both. This release adds the capability to support both platform at the same time (at different endpoints) and matures the features and provides numerous bug fixes.

Smaller improvements included in this release:
* Improved documentation and support edge cases when using the database query capabilities (contribution by [@minerva18](http://www.minerva18.com/) - thanks!).
* Both Google Dialogflow and Amazon Alexa are not enabled by default.
* Module dependencies were updated to include security fixes.
* The CFL `say` tag now works inside of an `item` tag as well as supports a `quick` attribute.
* When the CFL `resolve` tag calls into services these services can now return Promises which are waited on before returning back to the calling platform.
