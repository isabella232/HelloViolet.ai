# &lt;ask&gt;

When a voice scripts need information from the user, it does so using an `ask` element. The `ask` element contains the text to be presented to the user and is followed by allowing the user to answer back.

When a questions needs to be asked to the user, they need to make a decision and therefore the `ask` element typically are found inside a parent `decision` element.

See an example on the `ask` element on the [`decision`](/docs/conversation-decisions) element page.
