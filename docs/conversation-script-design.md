# Script Design

When building a conversational flow, it is best to start from a script of what you expect your users to say and what the system will say in return. This can be as simple as denoting User/System before each dialog in a Word Document:

* User: Hey, Voicebot - what time is it?
* System: It’s currently 11am.

This helps you track the kind of functionality you need by starting from a real conversational place, which helps with a more-engaging conversation as well as potentially needing less revisions later on when you test with users and notice that the conversation doesn’t flow like a real one would. This is because it’s often easier to see the back-and-forth of the conversation in a script than it is inside a flow.

It is often really helpful to build multiple such scripts for every major piece of functionality. In addition, writing a script for situations where there might be errors are very helpful as well. For example, it is helpful writing down where you believe that the request from the user might be unexpected to the system or where the response to the user might be unexpected, and how the system will help manage the situation.

Once you have a number of these scripts, it is a good idea to create a conversational flow. These can be thought of as a flow chart representing how the conversation will go. The Conversational Flow Language described here is an HTML-inspired representation for the same. Building out a conversational flow can allow you to see your whole conversation at a glance and allows for QA to more quickly and easily move through their work.

There’s much much more to say about writing the voice bot script and for that, our [resources](/docs/conversation-design-resources) have plenty of information for designers and developers alike, from people who’ve been at this for a while and can offer tips and tricks on how to best design for conversational UIs.
