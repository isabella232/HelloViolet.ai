Violet website pulling in documentation from the different Violet projects.

This repository has two branches:
- master: source files and scripts to generate the website
- gh-pages: content used by github-pages to host the site

### Running Locally
You can run the website locally by typing:
```
   bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Working with API Documentation
The generated navigation for the API Documentation has been customized in a few ways:
* Internal modules are hidden - these are the modules where the framework instantiates a supporting class.
* Classes are not shown as children of parent modules, since often instances of these Classes are returned through another Object.
* Plugins are separated out.

To see the generated list you can type the following in a web-browser:
```
   $('#generatedNav').show()
```

### Updating Generated (API) Documentation
API Documentation can be updated by making sure that the other violet projects are siblings to
this project with all repositories updated, and then typing:
```
   rm -rf api; jsdoc -c _jsdoc/conf.json
```

When the API documentation needs to be updated, the above command should be run in the `master` branch before running the `_publish.sh` script below.

### Publishing
Updated documentation and any other source files need to be copied to the `gh-pages` branch. The following command should help (assuming that the repository is checked out in a sibling directory, and that the code is run in the `master` directory):
```
  ./_publish.sh
  cd ../HelloViolet.ai-gh
  git status
  git commit -am 'Website update'
```
